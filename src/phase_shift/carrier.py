        Fitted quadratic curvature coefficients, in rad/pixel^2, for the
        term ``kxx*x^2 + kyy*y^2 + kxy*x*y``. All ``0.0`` when
        ``defocus=False``. ``kxx == kyy`` and ``kxy == 0`` corresponds to
        isotropic defocus (a spherical wavefront); ``kxx != kyy`` and/or
        ``kxy != 0`` describes astigmatic/cross-coupled curvature.
    piston : float

    to recover ``kxx, kyy, kxy``. Returns all zeros (with a warning) if
    fewer than 4 blocks have usable weight, since that under-determines the

    FFT + refine calls -- disproportionately expensive as GPU kernel-launch
    overhead -- with O(1) launches. Blocks are equal-size, obtained by
    cropping to the largest ``H', W'`` divisible by ``n_blocks`` (dropping at
    most ``n_blocks - 1`` pixels along the far edge of each axis) rather than
    the ragged groups ``np.array_split`` would give, so the block grid can be
    reshaped into a batch dimension instead of gathered with ``np.ix_``
    (which forces a copy per block).

    Unlike :func:`_estimate_tilt`, this is *not* bit-identical to a
    per-block-loop implementation using ``np.array_split`` for the block
    boundaries -- the different block boundaries (equal-size crop vs.
    ``array_split``'s ragged groups, plus dropped edge pixels) shift each
    block's local tilt estimate slightly, which the regression then
    propagates into ``kxx, kyy, kxy``. The resulting difference in the

    This removes the linear ramp ``kx*x + ky*y``, the constant ``piston``,
    and -- if ``defocus=True`` -- the quadratic curvature term
    ``kxx*x^2 + kyy*y^2 + kxy*x*y``, leaving ``wrap(phase_obj)``. It never
    unwraps: all estimation happens on the complex field ``exp(i*phi)``,
    so it is insensitive to how many fringes the carrier spans.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. **Coarse (FFT).** FFT the (optionally Hann-windowed, to suppress
       edge leakage) weighted complex field ``weight * exp(i*phi)``; the
       carrier shows up as the dominant off-DC peak. Its bin gives an
       integer-pixel estimate of the carrier frequency ``(fx, fy)`` in
       cycles/pixel. This step is what makes the method robust to a high
       carrier (many fringes across the field, near the Nyquist limit) --
       a pixel-to-pixel gradient estimate alone would alias there. The
       field is zero-padded to an FFT-efficient size for this step only
       (see :func:`_next_smooth`); it only has to localize the peak to
       within about one bin, which step 2 then resolves exactly.
    2. **Sub-pixel refinement (wrap-safe, closed-form).** The residual tilt
       after demodulating by the current ``(fx, fy)`` estimate is measured
       by vector averaging of neighboring-pixel phase differences --
       equivalent to a weighted circular mean of local gradients, so wraps
       in the residual don't bias the estimate the way a naive
       finite-difference-then-average would -- and, because that averaged
       quantity turns out not to depend on the current ``(fx, fy)`` guess at
       all (see :func:`_estimate_tilt`), is computed once and then iterated
       as a fixed point on two scalars rather than re-demodulating the full
       field ``refine_iters`` times. Steps 1-2 are :func:`_estimate_tilt`.
    3. **Curvature pre-correction (if ``defocus=True``), before step 1-2's
       final pass.** A quadratic phase is a 2D chirp: its local
       instantaneous frequency varies linearly with position (and, if the
       curvature is anisotropic, ``fx`` also varies with ``y`` and vice
       versa via the coupled ``kxy`` term). Splitting the field into an
       ``n_blocks x n_blocks`` grid and running steps 1-2 *within each
       block* (all blocks at once, see :func:`_estimate_curvature`) gives a
       local ``(fx, fy)`` sample at each block's center; jointly regressing
       those samples against block position recovers ``kxx, kyy, kxy``. The
       field is demodulated by ``kxx*x^2 + kyy*y^2 + kxy*x*y`` before the
       final, full-field tilt/piston pass, which then only has to polish the
       (typically much smaller) residual linear term.
    4. **Demodulate + piston.** Divide out the final carrier (and defocus,
       if applicable), then remove the constant phase offset via the
       (weighted) mean resultant vector.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phi : np.ndarray, shape (H, W)
        Wrapped phase map, in ``(-pi, pi]`` (e.g. :attr:`phase.solver.PhaseResult.phi`).
    weight : np.ndarray, shape (H, W), optional
        Per-pixel reliability used only for *estimating* the carrier (e.g.
        :attr:`phase.solver.PhaseResult.b`, the modulation map) --
        down-weights noisy, low-modulation pixels so they don't bias the
        fit. Negative values are clipped to 0. Does not affect the returned
        ``phi``, which is always computed from the unweighted field.
    mask : np.ndarray, shape (H, W), optional
        Boolean (or 0/1) map; pixels where it is falsey are excluded from
        estimation, same effect as ``weight=0`` there. Combined with
        ``weight`` if both are given.
    refine_iters : int, default 10
        Number of sub-pixel refinement iterations after each coarse FFT
        step (both the final full-field estimate and, if ``defocus=True``,
        each per-block estimate). The closed-form fixed-point refine (see
        Algorithm) typically converges in well under 10 iterations for a
        carrier that isn't near the Nyquist limit; raise it for a very high
        carrier, or lower it if profiling shows it converges sooner.
    window : bool, default True
        Apply a 2D Hann window before each coarse FFT to reduce spectral
        leakage from the field's edges (recommended; skipped automatically
        if the field being estimated has a size-1 axis).
    defocus : bool, default True
        Also fit and remove a quadratic curvature term
        ``kxx*x^2 + kyy*y^2 + kxy*x*y``, via the block-regression method
        above. Defaults on since most off-axis interferometry setups carry
        at least mild curvature from the reference wavefront; disable only
        for a field known to be curvature-free.
    n_blocks : int, default 10
        Grid size (``n_blocks x n_blocks``) for the curvature pre-estimate.
        Only used when ``defocus=True``. Needs at least 4 blocks with
        usable weight to fit (5 unknowns, 2 equations/block); falls back
        to ``kxx=kyy=kxy=0`` (with a warning) if fewer are available --
        e.g. too small an image for the requested grid, or ``weight``/
        ``mask`` leaving too little usable area.
    device : {"auto", "cpu", "cuda"}, default "auto"
        Where to run -- see :func:`phase.backend.to_device` for the full
        explanation. ``phi``/``weight``/``mask`` are uploaded if
        needed; the result's ``phi`` field stays on that same device rather
        than being downloaded automatically.

    Returns
    -------
    CarrierResult
        See :class:`CarrierResult`. ``phi`` is the object phase with the
        carrier (and curvature, if requested) and piston removed; ``kx,
        ky`` (rad/pixel) / ``fx, fy`` (cycles/pixel) describe the removed
        linear carrier; ``kxx, kyy, kxy`` (rad/pixel^2) the removed
        curvature terms (all ``0.0`` if not requested); ``piston`` the
        removed constant offset.

    Notes
    -----
    The block-regression estimate is exact for a pure carrier+curvature
    field with no other structure; on real data any genuine object phase
    with local structure comparable to
    the block size will mildly bias individual blocks' tilt estimates,
    the usual resolution/robustness trade-off of a block size -- fewer,
    larger blocks average out more of that bias but track less localized
    curvature. If ``kxx`` and ``kyy`` come back similar and ``kxy`` near
    0, the curvature is essentially isotropic (a spherical wavefront); if
    they differ substantially, that's astigmatism or a tilted/off-axis
    reference, both handled by this general form.

    """Per-frame carrier and DC amplitude, for gain/visibility estimation.

    The fringe pattern shows up as a carrier peak in each frame's 2D spectrum;
    integrating ``|F|^2`` over a small neighborhood around that peak
    (located once, from the frame-summed spectrum) gives a per-frame amplitude
    robust to small tilt/defocus jitter. The DC bin (``F[:, 0, 0]``),
    read off in the same pass, is the windowed-field analog of the background term ``a``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stack : np.ndarray, shape (N, H, W)
        Phase-shifted interferogram frames.
    dc_radius : int, default 8
        Half-size, in FFT bins, of the neighborhood around DC excluded
        before locating the carrier peak.
    halfwin : (int, int), default (3, 4)
        Half-size, in FFT bins along (row, column), of the neighborhood
        integrated around the located carrier peak.
    frame_chunk : int, default 8
        Number of frames' FFTs held resident at once (bounds peak memory
        regardless of ``N``; irrelevant to the result).
    dtype : numpy/cupy dtype, optional
        Working (real) dtype for the per-chunk FFT input. Defaults to
        ``float32`` (see :func:`phase.backend.default_dtype`).

    Returns
    -------
    carrier_amp, dc_amp : np.ndarray, each shape (N,)
        Per-frame carrier-peak amplitude and DC (zero-frequency) amplitude,
        both un-normalized.

    -----
    UserWarning
        If the located peak sits on the ``dc_radius`` exclusion boundary --
        a sign the true carrier frequency is too close to DC for this
        ``dc_radius``, so the "peak" found is likely background leakage
        rather than the genuine carrier, and the returned amplitudes are
        unreliable. Use a smaller ``dc_radius`` or verify the carrier

    Phase-recovery methods generally assume every frame shares one
    fringe-modulation map ``b(x, y)`` (Eq. (17) of
    ``docs/interference_model.md``); in practice illumination drift,
    source-coherence roll-off over a long scan, or per-shot exposure
    variation make the *true* per-frame contrast ``g_n`` deviate from 1 --
    sometimes by tens of percent. Forcing a shared ``b`` then makes the
    least-squares fit trade contrast error off against phase, producing an
    error that is a deterministic function of the local phase. This function
    measures ``g_n`` directly from the data, independent of any particular
    solve, so it can be supplied as a fixed input rather than estimated
    jointly with phase.

    Not part of :class:`phase.solver.PhaseSolver`'s solve path -- its
    ``gain_mode="joint"`` (the default) instead fits ``g_n`` inside the
    chosen method's own iteration (e.g. :func:`phase.methods.aia.aia`'s
    ``fit_gain``), which makes no assumption about the fringe pattern's
    spatial frequency. This function, and :func:`_carrier_dc_amplitudes`
    underneath it, locate a *linear* spatial-carrier sideband in each
    frame's 2-D FFT, so they give a wrong (or undefined) answer on circular
    or otherwise carrier-free fringes. Kept as a standalone utility -- pass
    its result as :class:`phase.solver.PhaseConfig`'s ``g`` yourself if you
    specifically want this carrier-peak estimate instead of the joint fit --
    and as the basis for :func:`measure_frame_visibility`, the

    The uniform-piston limit of ``docs/interference_model.md`` (its
    Eq. 20) models each frame as
    ``I_n = alpha_n * [a + g_n*b*cos(phi + delta_n)]``, so the *true*
    visibility of a fringe pattern is ``b/a`` (Michelson's
    ``(Imax-Imin)/(Imax+Imin)``). :func:`measure_frame_contrast` measures
    something proportional to ``b`` but normalizes it to ``median=1`` within
    its input stack, which makes it useless for comparing contrast *across*
    stacks -- e.g. one frame per position of a piezo coherence scan, where
    the whole point is to compare visibility across many separate captures.

    This returns ``2 * carrier_amp / dc_amp`` per frame (see
    :func:`_carrier_dc_amplitudes`): ``dc_amp`` is the windowed field's
    zero-frequency term, the same-pass analog of ``a``; the factor of 2
    accounts for a real cosine's energy splitting between the ``+`` and
    ``-`` carrier frequency, of which only the ``+`` side is integrated.
    For a field that is exactly ``a + b*cos(carrier)`` with no other
    spatial structure, this equals ``b/a`` exactly modulo windowing.

    In practice it is *proportional* to ``b/a``, not exactly equal --
    the Hann window used for peak-location suppresses the carrier and DC
    terms by different net factors, and real object phase structure (not
    just a pure linear carrier) spreads some of the carrier peak's energy
    into neighboring bins outside ``halfwin``. Both effects are constant
    for one fixed setup and ROI, so the value is safe to compare against
    itself over time or across piezo position -- e.g. as the per-frame
    metric for a coherence scan, or a coherence-zone drift log -- but is
    not a calibrated absolute number to compare across different setups
    or ROIs.

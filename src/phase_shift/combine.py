    Attributes
    ----------
    phi : np.ndarray, shape (H, W)
        Combined phase map, in ``(-pi, pi]``.
    scatter : np.ndarray, shape (H, W)
        Per-pixel circular standard deviation across the input acquisitions,
        in radians (``sqrt(-2*log(R))`` where ``R`` is the mean resultant
        length) -- the empirical, per-pixel uncertainty of ``phi``. Rises
        wherever the inputs disagree, e.g. low-modulation regions or spots
        where one acquisition had a local defect.
    mean_resultant : np.ndarray, shape (H, W)
        Per-pixel mean resultant length ``R`` in ``[0, 1]`` (1 = perfect
        agreement across acquisitions). ``scatter`` is a monotonic function
        of this; kept separately since ``R`` is also directly useful as a
        reliability weight (e.g. as ``weight=`` to
        :func:`~phase.carrier.remove_carrier`).
    n : int
        Number of acquisitions combined.
    sign_flips : list of int
        Indices (into the input ``phis``) whose sign branch was flipped
        (``-phi``) to match ``phis[reference]`` before averaging.

    """Average independent, repeated phase measurements of the same object.

    A single phase-recovery run's accuracy is limited by real acquisition-to-
    acquisition randomness (vibration, air currents, source noise) that does
    not average out within one run, only across independent runs -- unlike
    per-frame model errors (contrast, phase-step), which are systematic
    within a run and need a better model rather than averaging (see
    :class:`phase.solver.PhaseConfig`'s ``gain_mode`` and
    :func:`phase.utils.measure_frame_contrast`). Averaging ``k`` independent
    acquisitions brings this random component down as the expected
    ``1/sqrt(k)``.

    Three things must be resolved before a plain average of wrapped phase
    maps means anything, all handled here using existing functions in this
    package:

    1. **Sign branch** -- each phase-recovery run independently lands on
       ``+phi`` or ``-phi`` (see :func:`~phase.reference.subtract_reference`).
       Every map is resolved against ``phis[reference]`` the same way
       ``subtract_reference`` does, and flipped if that gives lower spread;
       see ``sign_flips``. This is done on the *raw* input maps, before
       carrier removal (step 2) -- the shared carrier (from the raw
       object/reference beam tilt, often many fringes) is a strong,
       unambiguous discriminant for the sign, whereas what two acquisitions
       of the same object still share *after* their own carriers are
       independently removed is only the real surface figure, which can be
       comparable in size to acquisition-to-acquisition noise and too
       marginal a signal to reliably resolve the branch from.
    2. **Inter-acquisition drift** -- tilt/piston (and, if ``align_carrier``
       includes ``defocus``, curvature) generally differ slightly between
       acquisitions of the same nominal setup. Each sign-resolved map is
       then passed through :func:`~phase.carrier.remove_carrier` so the
       average isn't blurred by chasing a moving carrier.
    3. **Circular averaging** -- phase is combined as the complex mean
       ``mean(weight * exp(i*phi))``, never an arithmetic mean of the
       wrapped angle.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phis : sequence of np.ndarray, each shape (H, W)
        Independently recovered phase maps of the *same* object (e.g. one
        per repeated scan). Pass :attr:`phase.solver.PhaseResult.phi` from
        separate :meth:`~phase.solver.PhaseSolver.fit` calls -- fit one
        stack at a time and keep only ``phi``/``b``, rather than holding
        every raw stack in memory at once.
    weights : sequence of np.ndarray, each shape (H, W), optional
        Per-acquisition, per-pixel reliability (e.g. each acquisition's
        :attr:`phase.solver.PhaseResult.b`). Used both for the
        carrier-removal step and the final weighted circular mean. Defaults
        to uniform weight.
    align_carrier : bool, default True
        Run :func:`~phase.carrier.remove_carrier` (with ``defocus=True``)
        on each map before combining. Turn off only if the maps are
        already known to share one carrier (e.g. already differenced
        against a reference).
    reference : int, default 0
        Index into ``phis`` that fixes the sign convention; every other map
        is oriented to agree with this one.
    carrier_kwargs : dict, optional
        Extra keyword arguments forwarded to the internal
        :func:`~phase.carrier.remove_carrier` calls (defaults to
        ``defocus=True, refine_iters=10, n_blocks=10``, matching
        ``remove_carrier``'s own defaults).
    device : {"auto", "cpu", "cuda"}, default "auto"
        Where to run -- see :func:`phase.backend.to_device` for the full
        explanation. Every array in ``phis``/``weights`` is uploaded if
        needed (they should already share one device -- e.g. all recovered
        by ``PhaseSolver(config, device="cuda")`` calls -- to avoid a
        per-acquisition transfer here); the result's array fields stay on
        that device rather than being downloaded automatically.

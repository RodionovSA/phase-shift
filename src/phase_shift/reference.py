        Resolved phase difference, in ``(-pi, pi]``.
    sign : int
        ``+1`` if ``phi_ref`` was used as-is (``phi - phi_ref``); ``-1``
        if ``phi_ref``'s sign branch was flipped before combining
        (``phi + phi_ref``) -- see :func:`subtract_reference` for why.
    spread_same : float
        Weighted circular RMS spread, in radians, of ``phi - phi_ref``.
    spread_flipped : float
        Weighted circular RMS spread, in radians, of ``phi + phi_ref``.
    ambiguous : bool
        True if ``spread_same`` and ``spread_flipped`` were too close to
        confidently pick a branch (see ``ambiguous_ratio``) -- the choice
        of ``sign`` shouldn't be trusted without visually checking ``phi``.

    """Combine a sample phase map with an independently-recovered reference.

    A reference measurement (same setup, no sample) is meant to capture
    whatever tilt/curvature/background aberration comes purely from the
    setup, so that subtracting it from a sample measurement's phase
    cancels that shared aberration and leaves only the sample-induced
    phase. This only works if ``phi`` and ``phi_ref`` share a common sign
    convention -- and a phase-shifting solve (see :mod:`phase.solver`)
    cannot guarantee that on its own.

    Why not: the phase-shifting model ``I_n = a + b*cos(phi + delta_n)``
    (the uniform-piston limit of ``docs/interference_model.md``, its
    Eq. 20) is exactly invariant under
    ``(phi, delta) -> (-phi, -delta)`` for every frame at once (cosine is
    even), so no method solving this model from intensity data alone can
    tell ``+phi`` from ``-phi``. Each independent solve converges to *one*
    of these two mirror-image branches, and nothing forces two separate
    runs (e.g. sample vs. reference) to land on the same one. If they land
    on opposite branches, naive ``phi - phi_ref`` *adds* the shared
    aberration instead of canceling it
    (``phi_true - (-phi_true) = 2*phi_true``), which can make the result
    visibly worse than not subtracting at all.

    This function resolves the branch automatically: it computes both
    ``phi - phi_ref`` and ``phi + phi_ref`` (wrap-safe, in the complex
    domain) and keeps whichever has lower spread -- the shared aberration
    is normally the dominant term in both ``phi`` and ``phi_ref``, so the
    correctly-signed combination should cancel most of it and come out
    with dramatically lower spread than the wrong one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phi : np.ndarray, shape (H, W)
        Sample phase map, in ``(-pi, pi]`` (e.g. :attr:`phase.solver.PhaseResult.phi`).
    phi_ref : np.ndarray, shape (H, W)
        Reference phase map, same shape as ``phi``.
    weight : np.ndarray, shape (H, W), optional
        Per-pixel reliability used to weight the spread comparison (e.g.
        the sample's modulation map) -- does not affect the returned
        ``phi`` itself, only which branch is judged better. Negative
        values are clipped to 0.
    mask : np.ndarray, shape (H, W), optional
        Boolean (or 0/1) map; pixels where it is falsey are excluded from
        the spread comparison. Combined with ``weight`` if both are given.
    ambiguous_ratio : float, default 1.5
        If the larger of the two spreads is less than this factor times
        the smaller, the branches aren't clearly distinguishable and
        ``ambiguous=True`` is returned (with a warning) -- e.g. because
        the shared aberration is small relative to noise/sample signal,
        or the two measurements didn't actually share much of a common
        aberration to cancel.
    device : {"auto", "cpu", "cuda"}, default "auto"
        Where to run -- see :func:`phase.backend.to_device` for the full
        explanation. ``phi``/``phi_ref``/``weight``/``mask`` are uploaded if
        needed; the result's ``phi`` field stays on that device rather than
        being downloaded automatically.

    Returns
    -------
    DifferenceResult
        See :class:`DifferenceResult`.

    Notes
    -----
    This resolves the sign ambiguity, not general drift between the two
    measurements. If the setup moved between the sample and reference
    shots, some residual tilt/curvature can remain in ``phi`` even after
    picking the right branch -- :func:`~phase.carrier.remove_carrier` can
    clean that up as a separate step, run on the *difference* map, not on
    ``phi``/``phi_ref`` individually beforehand.
